NEXT STEPS: ACCESS TO MORE DATA

Rockbuster sales data:  

To gain deeper insights into market and seasonal trends, it is essential to expand Rockbuster’s data beyond the current window of February 14 to May 14, 2007. 
Accessing a full and more current year of data would provide a more comprehensive view of customer behavior and rental patterns across different time periods.  
With a more robust dataset, Rockbuster can better forecast revenue fluctuations, optimize inventory management, and tailor marketing strategies to align with 
both high-demand and low-demand seasons. An expanded dataset will enable the company to make more informed decisions when launching targeted campaigns and planning 
future content acquisitions. 

Third-Party Data Partnerships: 

Collaborating with other companies (e.g. movie studios) to share user data and gain insights into cross-channel behaviors. 

Sentiment Analysis: 

Using natural language processing (NLP) to analyze customer reviews, feedback, and social media posts to understand customer emotions and preferences. 

Competitor Pricing & Promotions: 

Gathering data on pricing strategies, subscription models, and promotions used by competitors like Netflix, Amazon Prime, or other regional streaming services. 

Content Library Comparison: 

Analyzing competitors' movie and series catalogs to identify gaps or opportunities for unique content acquisition.

Focus on High-Performing Titles: 

Prioritize high revenue generating movie titles like Telegraph Voyage, Zorro Ark, Hustler Party, Harry Idaho and Torque Bound to roll out the online platform. 
These five movie titles brought in 51% ($955) of the total revenue in the top 10 ($1,890).
  
Leverage Regional Insights: 

Highest areas of customer concentration are: India, China, and the United States.   Of the total number of customers, 599, approximately 24% or 149 customers 
live in the top 3 countries.  A total of 315 customers live in the top 10, which is 47% of the total customer base at Rockbuster. 
  
Additionally, by implementing targeted loyalty programs, Rockbuster can strategically engage high lifetime value customers in each of these markets, fostering 
stronger customer relationships and driving long-term revenue growth. 
  
Create Region-Specific Marketing Strategies: 

The sales variations between geographic regions indicate the need for tailored approaches. The top and bottom revenue generating countries were India with 
$6,053 and Indonesia with $1,353. The top 3 revenue generating countries brought in a total of $14,971.  That’s approximately 47% of the revenue from the
top 10 countries ($31,834) and 24% of the total revenue ($61,312). 
  
Marketing strategies that were successful in India, China and the United States could be replicated in the bottom performing countries.  The bottom three 
performers in revenue - Indonesia ($1,353), Turkey ($1,498) and Philippines ($2,220) - brought in a total of $5,071, which is 6% of the revenue from the 
top 10 countries and 8% of the total revenue.
